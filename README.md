# 🐍 Python Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Python Practice Repository**!  
This repo contains all the practice code I wrote while learning Python step by step.

## 📚 Learning Source
I am following the **Python for Beginners series by [CodeWithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agICnT8t4iYVSZ3eykIAOME)** on YouTube.  
The practice files here are based on the concepts taught in those videos.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repo is organized into different topics as I practice:
- **Basics** → variables, input/output, operators  
- **Control Flow** → if-else, loops, range  
- **Functions** → defining and calling functions, recursion  
- **Data Structures** → lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries  
- **Practice Problems** → small coding challenges

## 🚀 Purpose
- Track my learning progress in Python  
- Build consistency through daily practice  
- Create a foundation for future learning in **AI, ML, and Software Development**
